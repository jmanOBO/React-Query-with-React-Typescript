# React Query with React Typescript

    If you check the tutorials that exists online about react query, you barely find the one dedicated to react typescript. At least that was my experience !
    But it's so simple to implement this awesome library with react typescipt. So if you are a fan of React Typescript like me, You should study this application to learn the following:

 React Query useQuery hook with react typescript
 React Query useQueries hook with react typescript
 React Query useInfiniteQuery hook with react typescript
 React Query useMutation hook with react typescript


# Other Libraries used

    React Router Dom
    Axios

# For the api

I made use of the json-server package. In this case I installed it globally on my system , you can choose to install yours in your project. And my data source for the api is data.json (included in the root of this project) . And here is the command to start up the the api server: json-server -w ./data.json . You can read more about this great package if you are unfamiliar with it.

    Enjoy!
