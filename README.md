# React Query with React Typescript

    If you check the tutorials that exists online about react query, you barely find the one dedicated to react typescript. At least that was my experience !
    But it's so simple to implement this awesome library with react typescipt. So if you are a fan of React Typescript like me, You should study this application to learn the following:

# React Query useQuery hook with react typescript
# React Query useQueries hook with react typescript
# React Query useInfiniteQuery hook with react typescript
# React Query useMutation hook with react typescript


# Other Libraries used

    React Router Dom
    Axios

    Enjoy!
